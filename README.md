# sharedb-mingo-memory

  [![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/sharedb-mingo-memory.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/sharedb-mingo-mongo)

A database adapter for [sharedb](https://github.com/share/sharedb)
that implements a subset of Mongo operations using an in-memory
database. Used by sharedb tests. Might be useful for running some
application tests faster by not requiring a full database.
